Trides 38ZT a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, weather, canyons and extinct volcanoes. Evidence shows it was once even more active in the past. It's solid surface has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.

Eluhiri is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, canyons, plains and more. Most of the planet is covered in water.

C-137 is a sanchezium giant and so switches from a solid to liquid to gas form. When it's in it's liquid or gas state it has a solid inner core only about the size of ASTER. C-137's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2), helium (He) and sanchezium (Sa3).

Terra's atmosphere was once 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients creating the perfect balance to support life, but many things have changed and but with a little work it can be transformed back to it's former glory.

Kalvaenus has a thin atmosphere, or exosphere, composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). Atoms that are blasted off the surface by the solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts create it's exosphere.

Coicle's solid seemingly uninterrupted surface hide's a volcanic landscape underneath, the inside of the planet is covered with extensive plains featuring high volcanic mountains and vast ridged plateaus.

ASTER is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core. It has an atmosphere made mostly of molecular hydrogen and atomic helium, with a small amount of methane. When a star is behind it, it reflects a calming blue light.

AQGUA is about four times wider than C-137. The surface of AQGUA is ninety percent water, which makes this planet the perfect resource acquisition. It has a very thin and tenuous atmosphere which is not breathable.
